Postmortem Report: WeatherWise Outage

Issue Summary:

    Duration: The outage occurred on March 14, 2024, from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM (UTC).
    Impact: WeatherWise experienced a service outage, rendering it inaccessible to users. All users attempting to access the application during this time were unable to retrieve weather updates.
    Root Cause: The outage was caused by a disruption in the OpenWeatherMap API service, resulting in the inability of WeatherWise to fetch real-time weather data.

Timeline:

    2:00 PM: Users reported the inability to access weather updates through WeatherWise.
    2:05 PM: Monitoring systems detected an increase in API request failures, indicating a potential issue with the OpenWeatherMap API.
    2:10 PM: Engineers investigated backend logs and confirmed that WeatherWise was unable to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
    2:15 PM: The incident was escalated to the technical team for further analysis and resolution.
    2:20 PM: Additional monitoring tools were utilized to verify the status of the OpenWeatherMap API, which was found to be experiencing service disruptions.
    2:30 PM: Engineers attempted to implement a temporary workaround by caching previously fetched weather data, but this proved unsuccessful due to the dynamic nature of weather updates.
    3:00 PM: Communication was initiated with the OpenWeatherMap support team to inquire about the cause of the API disruption and estimated time for resolution.
    3:30 PM: OpenWeatherMap API service was restored, and WeatherWise resumed normal operation.

Root Cause and Resolution:

    Cause: The outage was triggered by a disruption in the OpenWeatherMap API service, preventing WeatherWise from fetching real-time weather data.
    Resolution: The incident was resolved with the restoration of the OpenWeatherMap API service, allowing WeatherWise to retrieve weather updates as usual.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Improvements:
        Implement redundancy by integrating alternative weather APIs to mitigate the impact of future disruptions.
        Enhance monitoring capabilities to provide real-time alerts for API service disruptions and proactively notify users of potential outages.
        Develop a failover mechanism to switch between different weather APIs automatically in case of service disruptions.

    Tasks:
        Evaluate and integrate alternative weather APIs as backup sources for real-time weather data.
        Enhance monitoring configurations to include API status checks and set up automated alerts for service disruptions.
        Conduct regular drills to test failover mechanisms and ensure seamless transition between different weather data sources.

This incident underscores the importance of diversifying dependencies and implementing robust failover mechanisms to maintain service availability in the face of external disruptions.
